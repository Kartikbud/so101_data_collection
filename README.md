ROS2 based platform designed for collecting teleoperated data with the lerobot so-101 robotic arm from hugging face.
Currently work in progress:
- Succesfully integrated moveit with the hardware and setup a ros2_control_hardware interface to work with the urdf
- Need to implement the VR based teleop control using MoveIt Servo and OpenXR
